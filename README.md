# Twitch SFX

This is a single-page HTML file that can be used to generate sound effects from
polling twitch chat. If you're a streamer, maybe you could write you own custom
sfx and leave this page open in the background so it plays sounds. It also
functions as a full-featured chat interface (including displaying twitch emotes
correctly).

## Config

See [example.sfx](example.sfx) for an example SFX config file.
